This code demonstrates a credit card fraud detection system using logistic regression. The system is built to identify fraudulent transactions from a given dataset. Below is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

Import Libraries:
numpy for numerical operations.
pandas for data manipulation.
sklearn for machine learning and evaluation metrics.

Load Dataset:
The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame from a CSV file.

Inspect Dataset:
Display the first and last 5 rows of the dataset.
Display dataset information including data types and non-null counts.
Check for missing values in each column.
Display the distribution of legitimate (Class = 0) and fraudulent (Class = 1) transactions.

Separate Data:
Separate legitimate transactions (legit) and fraudulent transactions (fraud).
Display the shape of both subsets.

Statistical Analysis:
Display descriptive statistics for the Amount column in both legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
Compare the mean values for both transaction types.

Balance the Dataset:
Create a sample of legitimate transactions to match the number of fraudulent transactions.
Combine the sampled legitimate transactions and all fraudulent transactions into a new dataset.
Display the first and last 5 rows of the new dataset.
Check the distribution of transaction classes in the new dataset.
Display the mean values for each class in the new dataset.

Prepare Data for Training:
Define feature variables X and target variable Y.
Split the data into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split, with stratification based on the target variable.

Train Logistic Regression Model:
Initialize and train a logistic regression model using the training data.

Evaluate Model:
Predict and calculate the accuracy of the model on the training data.
Predict and calculate the accuracy of the model on the test data.
The output includes the accuracy of the model on both the training and test datasets, indicating the effectiveness of the logistic regression model in detecting fraudulent transactions.
